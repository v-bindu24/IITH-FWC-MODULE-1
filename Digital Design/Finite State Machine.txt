Finite State Machine:

A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a mathematical model used in digital design and computer science to represent a system's behavior. It is particularly useful for describing systems with a finite number of states and transitions between these states. FSMs are widely employed in the design of digital circuits, control systems, communication protocols, and various other applications.

Let's break down the key components of a Finite State Machine:

1. **States:**
   - A state is a specific condition or situation in which a system can exist at a given point in time.
   - In digital design, states often represent different operational modes or conditions of a system.
   - States are denoted by circles or ellipses in diagrams.

2. **Transitions:**
   - Transitions define the movement of the system from one state to another in response to an input or an event.
   - Transitions are represented by arrows between states and are labeled with the triggering input or condition.
   - Transitions can be triggered by external inputs, clock edges, or other events.

3. **Inputs:**
   - Inputs are external signals or events that trigger state transitions.
   - They are essential for determining the behavior of the system.
   - Inputs are usually denoted along the transition arrows.

4. **Outputs:**
   - Outputs are the results or actions produced by the system in response to inputs and its current state.
   - Outputs may be associated with specific states or transitions.
   - In some cases, outputs are not explicitly modeled in a finite state machine but are part of the overall system design.

5. **Initial State:**
   - The initial state is the starting point of the system.
   - It is the state the system is in when it is first activated or initialized.

6. **Final States:**
   - Final states (or accepting states) indicate the end of a specific behavior or sequence of events.
   - These states signify that a certain condition or task has been successfully completed.

### Types of Finite State Machines:

1. **Moore Machine:**
   - In a Moore machine, outputs are associated with states, meaning the output depends only on the current state.

2. **Mealy Machine:**
   - In a Mealy machine, outputs are associated with transitions, meaning the output depends on both the current state and the input.

### Finite State Machine Design Process:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - Clearly understand the behavior of the system and the requirements.

2. **Identify States:**
   - Determine the distinct states that the system can be in.

3. **Define Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Identify the inputs and outputs of the system.

4. **Define Transitions:**
   - Specify the conditions or inputs that cause transitions between states.

5. **Draw State Diagram:**
   - Create a visual representation of the finite state machine using circles for states, arrows for transitions, and labels for inputs and outputs.

6. **Implement:**
   - Develop the digital circuit or software based on the designed state machine.

Finite State Machines provide a systematic and structured approach to designing and understanding the behavior of systems, making them an integral part of digital design and control system engineering. They are especially useful in applications where a system can exist in a finite number of well-defined states, and its behavior can be modeled as a series of state transitions in response to external stimuli.

Differences between 7474 code and finite state machine code:

The provided code snippets are almost identical and serve the same purpose. Both code snippets are written in Arduino C++ and implement a simple digital display using a 7447 BCD-to-7-segment latch/decoder/driver IC. The display shows a binary count based on the states of four input switches (W, X, Y, Z). Below is a line-by-line comparison of the two code snippets:

### Similarities:
1. **Header Inclusion:**
   - Both codes include the Arduino header file (`#include <Arduino.h>`), which is necessary for using Arduino-specific functions and definitions.

2. **Global Variable Declaration:**
   - Both codes declare the same set of global variables (`int W, X, Y, Z; int D, C, B, A;`) to store the state of input switches and the BCD representation.

3. **Function Definition:**
   - Both codes define the same function (`disp_7447`) to control the 7447 BCD-to-7-segment display.

4. **Setup Function:**
   - The `setup` function in both codes configures the digital pins used for input and output.

5. **Loop Function:**
   - The `loop` function in both codes implements the main logic for updating the display based on the input switches.

6. **Display Control:**
   - Both codes use the same logic to control the 7447 display based on the current state of input switches.

7. **Delay:**
   - Both codes include delays to control the timing of the display updates.

### Differences:
1. **Pin Configuration:**
   - The pin configurations in terms of input and output are the same in both codes. However, there is one difference related to the display control. In Code-1, pin 13 is used as an output for controlling the display state (`digitalWrite(13, HIGH/Low)`), whereas, in Code-2, it is used for the same purpose. The specific purpose of this pin is not clear without additional context or documentation.

### Conclusion:
The two code snippets are nearly identical, with the only notable difference being the usage of pin 13 for display control. The functional behavior of both codes should be very similar, and they both achieve the goal of displaying a binary count on a 7-segment display based on the state of input switches. The difference in pin usage might be due to a slight modification or adaptation for different hardware setups or requirements.
